    "### Pauli group $P_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The group $P_n$ is formed by tensor products of the $P_1$ group which is the group generated by ${I, X, Z}$ (do we also allow $-I$?)\n",
    "The _weight_ of an element in the Pauli group is the number of non-identity operators in the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stabilizer group $S$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an abelian subgroup of $P_n$, which does not include $-I$. (Why not include $-I$? Because we're building it the other way around - we need to be able to find at least one state which is stabilized by all elements, and there is no such state if we include $-I$.) For each such group, we can define a code space:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(S) = \\{|\\psi\\rangle\\ |\\ M|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle, \\forall M\\in S\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Let's say this group has $n$ independent generators. (I think independence means that no generator is a product of the others). Then what is the size of the group? If our generators are say $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$, we can take the general product:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_1^{b_1}s_2^{b_2}...s_n^{b_n},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and for each number in the bitstring $b$ we have a different element, so the size of the group is $2^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's take an arbitrary $E\\in P_n$. There are 2 cases: Either it commutes with all elements in $S$ (that doesn't mean it's in $S$...) or it anticommutes with at least one of the elements in $S$. If it anticommutes, then if this $E$ is an error, it will leave a trace in the form of a -1 syndrome when we apply all the stabilizers on the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can define a set which does include *all* operators which commute with every element in $S$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(S) = \\{N\\in P_n \\ |\\ MN=NM, \\forall M\\in S\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "clearly every element in $S$ is there, but there are also other ones. Note that $N(S)$ is the *centralizer* of $S$, meaning it's a subgroup for which $S$ is the center. It is also the *normalizer*, and I think that for Paulis it's the same thing, because each product either commutes or anti-commutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The code distance\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the smallest weight Pauli in $N(S)\\backslash S$. Of course, we subtract $S$ because it is not related to the errors - it's just stabilizers. We don't care if our error is a stabilizer. For example, in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, the stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ, and wt 1 Pauli anti-commutes, while each wt 2 Pauli of the type XX or ZZ commutes. So the distance is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Short 9 qubit code, the situation is more interesting. Here every single weight Pauli obviously anticommutes. Errors of the type Z1Z2 are in $S$, and Z3Z4 anti commutes with X4...X9. X1X2 anticommutes with Z2Z3, and X3X4 anticommutes with Z2Z3 and Z4Z5. But X1X2X3 commutes with Z1Z2, Z2Z3, and trivially with all others. So the distance is 3."
